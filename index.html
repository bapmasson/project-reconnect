              <p>If you've ever left a message for more than a week without an answer, and especially if you tend to make it a habit, take a look at our app. ADHD people are subject to this type of behaviour, it doesn't mean it is a fatality. </p>

              <p>When you know you should reply to someone you care about, it stays in a corner of your mind and you can feel ashamed. The mental charge of this could grow quickly. This behaviour will eventually hurt the people facing your silence. </p>

              <p>Our app will suggest you to send regular messages to people depending on when was your last interaction and how you place them in your personal circle. With our integrated IA features, it can also suggest to you pre-wrote messages refering to your past conversations. Never ghost anyone anymore ! </p>
